# RUOCHEN'S FIRST EVER R MARKDOWN!

### Hello worlddddd

Date: 2.5.2020

```{r setup, include = FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = T)

```

```{r load-packages, message = F}
library(tidyverse)

```

```{r make-plot, echo = F}
storms %>%
  group_by(year) %>%
  summarize(wind = mean(wind)) %>%
  ggplot(mapping = aes(x = year, y = wind)) +
  geom_line() +
  geom_point() +
  theme_bw()

```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
